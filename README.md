<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
Space invaders is a classic arcade game.In this game, we simply have to stop the invaders to conquer our boundary.Our nemeses are the aliens and the player mode can either be single or multi-player.We have developed this game using python and also, have modified to SpongeBob theme.
<h3>FEATURES</h3>
The functionalities of the game "Krusty Krab" are mentioned below:
<ol>    
  <li> The player fires a laser cannon horizontally at the invaders across the bottom of the screen.
    <li> The invader(alien) gets destroyed if it gets hit by the player's bullet.
      <li> The player is allocated 3 lives and it loses 1 life everytime it gets hit by the enemy bullet.
        <li> The game is over when the player is shot thrice.
